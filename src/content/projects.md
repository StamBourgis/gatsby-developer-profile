 ### A web app allowing people to get garden help ###
 The Green Warriors app is an app I developed born to address a real need! 
 
 My wife and I recently moved in a property (good bargain they said!) with a big garden, one of these that need constant attention to maintain. As I hate any form of manual labour (especially gardening), I would be more than happy to pay a gardener to, maybe once a month, keep the garden from turning into the jungle that it is!
 Trouble is, the only recommended gardener is always busy and has turned us down multiple times! So if anything, this app will help me find a gardener to help keep this place in shape. 

#### Do you love gardening? Why not make some money doing what you love?
